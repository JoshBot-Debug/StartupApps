# How to use

- Add startupapps to your path to make life more easy

- Set up a config file by opening command prompt in the directory you want to create a config file and then setup the config file EXAMPLE : "startupapps -c "chrome github.com" -c "C:\somefolder\paint.exe" -c "code ." -p "C:/myfolder/files"

- To run an application use -c "path/to/the/exe/file" or "PATH executable and args", To open a directory use -p "path/to/the/folder". 

- This will generate a config file in the folder you were in.

- After a config file has been generated, just run "startupapps" in the directory where the config file is and all the applications specified in the config file will start.
